The file validator, seperator, and extractor will insert functions using regular expressions to validate, separate, and extract common data formats.
Using py.test tests will try validate values, as I write code it will either fail or pass depending on how well I understand regular expressions and the tests.

How to run:
pip install requirements to install py test or install from pytest website.
from the terminal just type py.test
